Camera trap data on medium to large terrestrial mammals ("Species") collected at 54 camera stations ("Station") in Ruaha National Park, southern Tanzania. Sampling was carried out for two months during the dry season of 2013 (D under "Season") and two months during the wet season of 2014 (W under "Season"). Each camera station is associated with a randomly placed camera (Random under "Placement") and a trail-based camera (Trail under "Placement"), with the aim of comparing communities resulting from the two camera trap placement strategies. The date and time of each photographic event is also given ("DateTime").
