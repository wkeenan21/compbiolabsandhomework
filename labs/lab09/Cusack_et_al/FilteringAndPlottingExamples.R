# ---------- PART 1: Filtering and analyzing with basic functions --------------- #

# get rows of data for elephants in the wet season:
# use row indexing with vectorized conditionals
elephantsWet <- camData[camData$Species == "Elephant" & camData$Season == "W", ]

# here's an alternative using the subset function
# elephantsWet2 <- subset(camData, Species == "Elephant" & Season == "W")
# all(elephantsWet == elephantsWet2)  # check that results are the same

# cross tabulate:
eletab <- with(elephantsWet, table(Station, Placement))
# take a look:
ftable(eletab)    # ftable() makes a more "attractive" looking output
# looks like a table with a bunch of rows corresponding to station names, and 
# then columns for placement: one for the random and one for the trail for each station.
# Coercing to data frame can help analysis:
eleframe <- as.data.frame(eletab)
# take a look and commpare with the table above:
eleframe
# boxplot can split frequencies by any variable in the data frame:
boxplot(eleframe$Freq ~ eleframe$Placement)

# as.data.frame() stacked the data.  Suppose I want it unstacked?
# first, get the frequency data:
elemat <- matrix(as.numeric(eletab), ncol = ncol(eletab))
# make a data frame with those data plus the station names as a variable:
eleframe <- data.frame(row.names(eletab), elemat)
# add column names:
colnames(eleframe) <- c("Station", dimnames(eletab)$Placement)
# take a look:
eleframe
# same boxplot as above, but with separate columns now:
boxplot(eleframe$Random, eleframe$Trail)
# finally, how about true pairwise comparisons, within "Station"
boxplot(eleframe$Random - eleframe$Trail)
# the latter shows that the large majority are negative, i.e., trail observations
# tend to be greater than random, controlling for location (by making the comparison
# within data pairs)

# that was 12 lines of code total to get all of that, with nothing beyond base R
# and three of those lines are just prints to the console, so it's only 9 lines of actual code!

# ------------------------------- PART 2 ------------------------------------ #
# --------------------- How about more variables at once? --------------------#

# cross tabulate for Species and Placement:
allTab <- with(camData, table(Species,Placement))
ftable(allTab) # shows a single data point per placement
# Given that this only gives a single data point per placement type,
# we realize we have lost the Station information, and thus this is NOT what we want.

# Re-do the crosstabulation with station information:
allTab <- with(camData, table(Species,Station,Placement))
ftable(allTab) # each species has multiple data points, one
               # per recording station
# Convert to data.frame for more ease of analysis:
alldf <- as.data.frame(allTab)
# make plotting easy with ggplot:
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(alldf, aes(x = Placement, y = Freq, fill = Placement)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(~Species, scale="free")
# interpretation of ggplot command:
  # line 1: make a ggplot object, with 
    # x axis variable = Placement
    # y axis variable = Freq (frequency count)
    # fill color will correspond to Placement (like x axis)
  # line 2: make a boxplot type of plot
  # line 3: make a multi-panel plot, where each panel 
      # corresponds to a different species, and let the y-axis
      # scaling vary between plots

# That was a crazy amount of plots!  And it only took TWO lines of
# code followed by a 3-line ggplot() command!!  


# -------------------------- PART 3 ---------------------------#
# -------------- subsetting AND cross-tabulation ------------- #

# Given that the last part made a crazy number of plots, 
# how about the 12 most common species?
# And how about splitting up the data for wet and dry seasons?

topNum <- 12  # number of species to keep
# first, figure out most common species observations.
# frequency count by species:
speciesCounts <- table(camData$Species) 
# sort them:
speciesCounts <- sort(speciesCounts, decreasing = T)
# take a look:
show(speciesCounts)
# get the names of the most common species:
topSpecies <- names(speciesCounts[1:topNum])
# take a look:
topSpecies
# now subset the data:
keepRows <- (camData$Species %in% topSpecies)
cat(paste("\nNumber of observations kept = ", sum(keepRows), "\n"))
topSpeciesData <- camData[keepRows, ]
# make a cross tabulation using all variables except 
# Reference and DateTime:
allTab <- with(topSpeciesData, table(Species,Station,Placement,Season))
# convert to data frame:
alldf <- as.data.frame(allTab)

# Note that the previous 10 lines of code, minus commands that print to screen, could
# be easily turned into a function for subsetting the data by species. Only 7
# lines of actual code do all that work!

# use ggplot to break it down by species, placement, and season:
ggplot(alldf, aes(x = Season, y = Freq, fill = Placement)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(~Species, scale="free")
